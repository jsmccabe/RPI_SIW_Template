# RPI_SIW_Template

This is a LaTeX template for the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute's Space Imaging Workshop. 

Users are encouraged to utilize the `RPI-SIW.cls` file in the `/src/` directory.  See `/src/RPI_SIW_Template.tex` for implementation details. 

Designed to compile with LuaLaTeX, but build tests appear to clear just fine with pdfLaTeX.

For bug reports and feature requests, please submit a detailed issue. 

### Build-tested on: 
- MacOS High Sierra, MacTeX 2017 (03/16/19)
- MacOS High Sierra, MacTeX 2018 (03/16/19)
